# GDLK

## About

GDLK is a programming language, as well as a game based on solving puzzles with the language. There is no usable product _yet_, but it's coming soonâ„¢!

GDLK Development Language Kit!

## Development

### Setup

First, you'll need to install:

- `docker-compose`
- `rustup`

Then, for development you'll probably want to install more stuff:

```sh
rustup component add rustfmt-preview clippy-preview
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
cargo install cargo-make
```

### Compiling and Executing Locally

If you just want to compile and run a program without starting up the webserver, you can use the CLI for that. To execute a program, you will need:

- A hardware spec, which defines what hardware the program can access (JSON)
- A program spec, which defines the input and expected output (JSON)
- A source file (GDLK)

See `core/src/models.rs` for a list of fields that the hardware and program specs need. Then, you can run the program with:

```sh
cargo run -p gdlk_cli -- run --hardware hw.json --program prog.json -s prog.gdlk
```

### Running the Web Stack

Unfortunately, until [this GitHub bug](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/docker-pull-from-public-GitHub-Package-Registry-fail-with-quot/td-p/32782/page/2) is fixed, you'll have to login in to the GitHub docker registry in order to pull the images. [Go here to create a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and give it these permissions:

- `write:packages`
- `read:packages`
- `delete:packages`

Then, in the repo root, run:

```sh
docker login docker.pkg.github.com
# Enter your username and the new token as your password
docker-compose up
```

Then, see the next section to initialize the DB.

### Migrations & Seed Data

Migrations are managed by Diesel. Seed data is defined via SQL scripts, in `api/seeds`.

```sh
cd api
# Migrations are automatically run on server startup, but if you need to run them manually:
cargo make diesel migration run

# You can load seed data with:
cargo make seed

# If you need to re-run migrations (this will wipe out your DB!)
cargo make diesel db reset
```

### Tests

You can run tests with:

```sh
cargo make test # In the root, or any sub-crate
```

### Debugging

If you have a GDLK program or test failing, you can have the GDLK compiler and interpreter output additional debug information by setting `DEBUG=1`.

```sh
DEBUG=1 cargo run -p gdlk_cli -- --hardware hw.json --program prog.json -s prog.gdlk
DEBUG=1 cargo make test
```

### Nightly Rust

We use nightly Rust. Here's a list of reasons why. If this list every gets empty, we should switch to stable.

- Rust features
  - [const_fn](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/57563)
- Rustfmt
  - [merge_imports](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3362)
  - [wrap_comments](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3347)

[Here's a helpful site for finding new nightly versions](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/).
